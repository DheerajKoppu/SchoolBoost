# SchoolBoost

School Boost is a web-based program designed to help improve student involvement at Cypress High School by tracking student participation and attendance at school events. Once students participate or attend events, they are awarded points. The program has a way to pick a random winner each quarter from each grade level, as well as the student with the top point accumulation. The number of points a person has accumulated will translate to the prize they will win. The program has three prizes (a school reward, a food reward, and a school spirit item). The program also includes a leaderboard to track the top participants and the amount of time they spent participating.
